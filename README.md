# Neural-Style-Transfer

This project implements Neural Style Transfer, a technique to apply the artistic style of one image to the content of another image. The project is built using Python 3.7.16 and TensorFlow 1.15.0, with VGG19 as the chosen Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The optimization process utilizes the L-BFGS optimizer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7.16
- TensorFlow 1.15.0
- Scipy 1.2.0

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
